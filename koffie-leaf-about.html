            <p class = "our-story">
		       Koffie Leaf was started by two brothers Sam and Joe from South Africa. 
			   Sam and Joe are two baristas who love coffee and coffee art. 
			   Once they started working as baristas, they knew that they wanted to open 
               one of their own. Their love and determination resulted in the creation of Koffie Leaf. 
               There is currently only one Koffie Leaf which is located in San Francisco, California.
			   Sam and Joe are always experimenteing with coffee art designs and 
               coffee flavors to keep the menu fresh and exciting. And their 
               new offers always keep customers wondering what will be on the menu next.
            </p>
